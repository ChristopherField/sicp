For very small numbers e.g. the sqrt of .000001 our test will not work because it is hard coded to .001 so it will not be able to get very close to the final number.  Additionally floating point numbers are not represented exactly in the computer.  In some computers .1 is impossible to represent exactly and you end up with .09999999999 or some similar business, meaing that there is error even greater than the tolerance being sought.

With large numbers the problem is that they are often represented as floating points and with limited numbers of bits.  So if you try to do subtraction you lose the lower order terms.  E.g. in a really limited computer perhaps 1 million is represented as 1 times 10 to the 6th.  So if I get close (but still far) I might end up with some number like 1000.1 which is 1000200.01 but because cannot represent that entire number, I only see 1 times 10 to the 6th - 1 times 10 to the 6th which is 0 and is less than the tolerance.  Even though the real difference is over 200.  Granted 1 million is way too small for this to be an issue, but for larger numbers it is.  The numbers are represented imperfectly and some low order bits are lost, and these bits can hide pretty large differences.

Another problem which I experienced is that as you get close to the square root the improve procedure results in less and less changes.  First you change large numbers e.g. 1 and 5 the first guess is 5/1 + 1 aka 6 / 2 so the next guess is 3.  But the closer you get the less the number changes until good-enough? detects a change small enough to be the tolerance.  If for a big number you are losing lower order terms and the difference between guess and (improve guess) is within those low order terms, you end up with (improve guess) spitting out the same guess and an infinite loop if the difference between (square guess) and x is larger than the tolerance in (good-enough?).  I plugged in a random large number and that's what happened to me, (improve guess) was spitting out the same number...but it was not (good-enough?)....
